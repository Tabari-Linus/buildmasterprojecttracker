# Performance Profiling Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the initial performance profiling conducted on the application, focusing on critical bottlenecks, memory usage patterns, response times, and specific issues identified from the provided `Initial aggregate.csv` data and subsequent analysis of VisualVM and Heap Dump data.

## üö® Executive Summary

The application is experiencing **severe performance issues** with core API endpoints exhibiting response times averaging **15-20 seconds**. This represents a critical bottleneck that significantly impacts user experience and system throughput.

## üìä Key Findings

### Primary Bottlenecks Identified

Based on the `Initial aggregate.csv` data analysis, three API endpoints have been identified as critical performance bottlenecks:

#### **GET /api/v1/projects**
- **Average Response Time**: 15.9 seconds (15,926ms)
- **99th Percentile**: 25.7 seconds (25,756ms)
- **Throughput**: ~8-9 requests/second
- **Impact**: High - Core functionality severely impacted

#### **GET /api/v1/tasks**
- **Average Response Time**: 18.1 seconds (18,166ms)
- **99th Percentile**: 27.1 seconds (27,162ms)
- **Throughput**: ~8-9 requests/second
- **Impact**: High - Task retrieval operations critically slow

#### **POST /api/v1/tasks**
- **Average Response Time**: 19.9 seconds (19,910ms)
- **99th Percentile**: 27.0 seconds (27,077ms)
- **Throughput**: ~8-9 requests/second
- **Impact**: High - Task creation severely delayed

### Response Time Analysis

| Endpoint | Average (ms) | Median (ms) | 90% (ms) | 95% (ms) | 99% (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Login** | 124 | 124 | 124 | 124 | 124 | 124 | 124 |
| **GET /api/v1/projects** | 15,926 | 17,261 | 22,592 | 24,052 | 25,756 | 5 | 27,472 |
| **GET /api/v1/tasks** | 18,166 | 19,723 | 23,743 | 25,706 | 27,162 | 29 | 31,898 |
| **POST /api/v1/tasks** | 19,910 | 21,007 | 25,746 | 26,097 | 27,077 | 76 | 31,765 |
| **OVERALL** | 17,931 | 19,767 | 23,682 | 25,767 | 26,900 | 5 | 31,898 |

### Key Observations

- **Login Performance**: Excellent performance with consistent 124ms response times
- **Core Endpoints**: Catastrophic performance with 15-20 second average response times
- **Variance**: High variability in response times (min: 5ms, max: 31,898ms)
- **System Average**: 17.9 seconds overall average response time

## üß† Memory Usage Patterns

Analysis of the VisualVM and Heap Dump data. Please provide findings from:

![Heap Dump Analysis](docs/images/Heap%20Dump%20after%205%20minutes.png)

**Analysis needed for**:
- Memory leak detection
- Object accumulation patterns
- Garbage collection behavior
- Heap utilization trends

## üîç Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Severe Response Time Degradation
The core API endpoints are experiencing response times that are **orders of magnitude higher** than acceptable performance standards:
- Industry standard: < 200ms for API responses
- Current performance: 15,000-20,000ms average
- **Performance Gap**: 75-100x slower than target

### 2. Low System Throughput
- Current throughput: 8-9 requests/second for core endpoints
- This severely limits concurrent user capacity

### 3. Potential Root Causes
Based on the performance profile, likely causes include:
- **Database Performance**: Inefficient queries or missing indexes
- **N+1 Query Problems**: Multiple database calls per request
- **Resource Contention**: Blocking operations or insufficient connection pooling
- **Memory Issues**: Potential memory leaks affecting performance
- **Infrastructure Bottlenecks**: CPU, I/O, or network constraints


**Status**: Initial Analysis - Requires Memory Analysis Completion
